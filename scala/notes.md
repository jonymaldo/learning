# Scala notes

1. In order to make implicits work, they should be defined before the code that uses it

## Type classes

1. The idea with case classes is to be able to define a single function that could be able to work on a parametric type, and later add implementations for specific types. Usually the polymorfic 
2. Interface syntax defines an implicit class that is able to translate a specific type o another one in this case we make use of case type classes
